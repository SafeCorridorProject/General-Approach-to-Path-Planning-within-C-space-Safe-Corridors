In this repository there is the source code for recreating the simulations obtained in the paper 
"A General Approach to Path Planning within C-space Safe Corridors." The main classes and related methods for creating the robot models are defined, which are: ChJoint, ChPlanModel, ChPlanner. In addition, a class is provided to be able to define 6-axis robots: ChRobot, ChRobot_6dof, ChRobot_6dof_CAD. The search algorithm in the C-space is GbpfAlgorithmCuboid. The various CAD models are present in the appropriate folders: "CAD_model" for the first simulation environment (blocks), "shelves" for the second simulation environment, and finally "laser" for the third simulation environment. In addition, the CAD export folders are present, thus with the corresponding .cpp and .h files. CAD_export2 for the first simulation (blocks), CAD_export3 for the second simulation (shelves), and CAD_export_new for the third simulation (laser). It is possible to run the simulations via the "Example" file in the "laser_env" branch. Installation of the “Project Chrono” software (https://projectchrono.org/) and the various dependencies (https://api.projectchrono.org/install_guides.html) is required for proper operation. There is also, a folder containing the files needed to perform trajectory optimization called “Spline Optimization”. The optimization is performed through the “main_multiobj” file in which you can go and enter the start and goal data, lower and upper bounds, and consequently the alpha1 and alpha2 parameters mentioned in the paper.
